# Git Branch Workflow
**Work on a new feature :**
  
make a new branch   ```git branch <nameN>```
  
switch to that branch ```git checkout <nameN>```

make changes

done ```git add .```    ```git commit -m "msg"```    ```git push -u <reponame> <nameN>"```

switch back to master branch ```git checkout <mastername>"```

get the latest version of master branch  ```git pull <reponame> <remote branch name>```

merge branch  ```git merge <nameN>"```

if not conflict then update main branch  ```git push <reponame> <remote branch name>```

delete local branch  ```git branch -d <nameN>```

delete remote new branch  ```git push <reponame> --delete <nameN>
